Stage idea:

Here we should manually add Gson library for serializing/deserializing.

For gradle kts: implementation("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6")

After that we should create a class for serialization ours login and password

data class LoginCredentials(val email: String, val password: String)

And add a proper annotations for serializing.

Next step is to perform a login request. It will be a POST request to https://hyperskill.org/api/profiles/login

It consumes our serialized json class as body, Referer and X-CSRFToken as headers.

(explain here a Referer and csrf-token headers)

After login process will be finished we should to enable login button and hide progress bar.
