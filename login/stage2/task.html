Stage idea:

Here we create a network request for accessing some cookies and return a response.

The network request officially starts in another thread due to NetworkOnMainThreadException.
We also must remember to declare INTERNET permission in our android.Manifest file.

We can create a thread with construction

thread(start = false, isDaemon = true) {
// here some network code
}

To create a request we first need to create a network client which does most of the job.
For OkHttp it is really easy. This client shouldn't be a private in the class because
we need an access to it in our tests.

val client = OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor().build()

We add a CookieJar for storing cookies between requests.
This interface can be easily implemented with the next logic:
    - store all cookies in HashMap<HttpUrl, ArrayList<Cookie>>
    - when we need to use cookies just return all of them using hashMap.values.flatten() method.

    We also should add a Stage2TestInterceptor for a better test experience with networking,
    so if you try to ignore it whole network tests will be automatically failed. JFYI.

    Now it's a good point to create a request.

    val request = Request.Builder().get().url("https://hyperskill.org").build()

    This request just goes to the hyperskill domain for receiving necessary for future cookies.

    For performing created request just call

    val response = client.newCall(request).execute()

    In the response variable, our networking result will be placed.
